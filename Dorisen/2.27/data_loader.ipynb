A ll aspects of virtual w orld display, interaction \\nand internetw orking can be specified using V R M L. It is the intention of its designers that \\nV R M L becom e the standard language for interactive sim ulation w ithin the W orld W ide \\nW eb.  \\nThe first version of V R M L allow s for the creation of virtual w orlds w ith lim ited \\ninteractive behavior. These w orlds can contain objects w hich have hyperlinks to other \\nw orlds, H TM L docum ents or other valid M IM E types. W hen the user selects an object \\nw ith a hyperlink, the appropriate M IM E view er is launched. W hen the user selects a link \\nto a V R M L docum ent from  w ithin a correctly configured W W W  brow ser, a V R M L \\nview er is launched. Thus V R M L view ers are the perfect com panion applications to \\nstandard W W W  brow sers for navigating and visualizing the W eb. Future versions of \\nV R M L w ill allow  for richer behaviors, including anim ations, m otion physics and real-\\ntim e m ulti-user interaction.  \\nThis docum ent specifies the features and syntax of V ersion 1.0 of V R M L.  \\nV R M L  M ission Statem ent \\nThe history of the developm ent of the Internet has had three distinct phases; first, the \\ndevelopm ent of the TC P/IP infrastructure w hich allow ed docum ents and data to be stored \\nin a proxim ally independent w ay; that is, Internet provided a layer of abstraction betw een \\ndata sets and the hosts w hich m anipulated them . W hile this abstraction w as useful, it w as \\nalso confusing; w ithout any clear sense of \"w hat w ent w here\", access to Internet w as \\nrestricted to the class of sysops/net surfers w ho could m aintain internal cognitive m aps of \\nthe data space.  \\nN ext, Tim  B erners-Lee\\'s w ork at C ER N , w here he developed the hyperm edia system  \\nknow n as W orld W ide W eb, added another layer of abstraction to the existing structure. \\nThis abstraction provided an \"addressing\" schem e, a unique identifier (the U niversal \\nR esource Locator), w hich could tell anyone \"w here to go and how  to get there\" for any \\npiece of data w ithin the W eb. W hile useful, it lacked dim ensionality; there\\'s no there \\nthere w ithin the w eb, and the only type of navigation perm issible (other than surfing) is \\nby direct reference. In other w ords, I can only tell you how  to get to the V R M L Forum  \\nhom e page by saying, \"http://w w w .w ired.com /\", w hich is not hum an-centered data. In'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GNU Ghostscript 6.51', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/test_pdf.pdf', 'total_pages': 4, 'page': 1, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content='APPROVED!!!\\nfact, I need to m ake an effort to rem em ber it at all. So, w hile the W orld W ide W eb \\nprovides a retrieval m echanism  to com plem ent the existing storage m echanism , it leaves \\na lot to be desired, particularly for hum an beings.  \\nFinally, w e m ove to \"perceptualized\" Internetw orks, w here the data has been sensualized, \\nthat is, rendered sensually. If som ething is represented sensually, it is possible to m ake \\nsense of it. V R M L is an attem pt (how  successful, only tim e and effort w ill tell) to place \\nhum ans at the center of the Internet, ordering its universe to our w him s. In order to do \\nthat, the m ost im portant single elem ent is a standard that defines the particularities of \\nperception. V irtual R eality M odeling Language is that standard, designed to be a \\nuniversal description language for m ulti-participant sim ulations.  \\nThese three phases, storage, retrieval, and perceptualization are analogous to the hum an \\nprocess of consciousness, as expressed in term s of sem antics and cognitive science. \\nEvents occur and are recorded (m em ory); inferences are draw n from  m em ory \\n(associations), and from  sets of related events, m aps of the universe are created (cognitive \\nperception). W hat is im portant to rem em ber is that the m ap is not the territory, and w e \\nshould avoid becom ing trapped in any single representation or w orld-view . A lthough w e \\nneed to design to avoid disorientation, w e should alw ays push the envelope in the kinds \\nof experience w e can bring into m anifestation!  \\nThis docum ent is the living proof of the success of a process that w as com m itted to being \\nopen and flexible, responsive to the needs of a grow ing W eb com m unity. R ather than re-\\ninvent the w heel, w e have adapted an existing specification (O pen Inventor) as the basis \\nfrom  w hich our ow n w ork can grow , saving years of design w ork and perhaps m any \\nm istakes. N ow  our real w ork can begin; that of rendering our noospheric space.  \\nH istory \\nV R M L w as conceived in the spring of 1994 at the first annual W orld W ide W eb \\nC onference in G eneva, Sw itzerland. Tim  B erners-Lee and D ave R aggett organized a \\nB irds-of-a-Feather (B O F) session to discuss V irtual R eality interfaces to the W orld W ide \\nW eb. Several B O F attendees described projects already underw ay to build three \\ndim ensional graphical visualization tools w hich interoperate w ith the W eb. A ttendees \\nagreed on the need for these tools to have a com m on language for specifying 3D  scene \\ndescription and W W W  hyperlinks -- an analog of H TM L for virtual reality. The term  \\nV irtual R eality M arkup Language (V R M L) w as coined, and the group resolved to begin \\nspecification w ork after the conference. The w ord \\'M arkup\\' w as later changed to \\n\\'M odeling\\' to reflect the graphical nature of V R M L.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GNU Ghostscript 6.51', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/test_pdf.pdf', 'total_pages': 4, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}, page_content='APPROVED!!!\\nShortly after the G eneva B O F session, the w w w -vrm l m ailing list w as created to discuss \\nthe developm ent of a specification for the first version of V R M L. The response to the list \\ninvitation w as overw helm ing: w ithin a w eek, there w ere over a thousand m em bers. A fter \\nan initial settling-in period, list m oderator M ark Pesce of Labyrinth G roup announced his \\nintention to have a draft version of the specification ready by the W W W  Fall 1994 \\nconference, a m ere five m onths aw ay. There w as general agreem ent on the list that, w hile \\nthis schedule w as aggressive, it w as achievable provided that the requirem ents for the \\nfirst version w ere not too am bitious and that V R M L could be adapted from  an existing \\nsolution. The list quickly agreed upon a set of requirem ents for the first version, and \\nbegan a search for technologies w hich could be adapted to fit the needs of V R M L.  \\nThe search for existing technologies turned up a several w orthw hile candidates. A fter \\nm uch deliberation the list cam e to a consensus: the O pen Inventor A SC II File Form at \\nfrom  Silicon G raphics, Inc. The Inventor File Form at supports com plete descriptions of \\n3D  scenes w ith polygonally rendered objects, lighting, m aterials, am bient properties and \\nrealism  effects. A  subset of the Inventor File Form at, w ith extensions to support \\nnetw orking, form s the basis of V R M L. G avin B ell of Silicon G raphics has adapted the \\nInventor File Form at for V R M L, w ith design input from  the m ailing list.
